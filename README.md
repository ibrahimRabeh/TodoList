# Todo Website

This is a Todo website that allows users to manage their tasks effectively. It is built with TypeScript and SCSS.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Users can add, delete, and edit tasks. Each task has a title, description, due date, priority level, and a status indicating whether it is done or not.
- **Project Management**: Users can create custom projects and assign tasks to them. Each project has a name and a list of tasks.
- **Task Sorting**: Tasks within a project are sorted according to their priority level.
- **Persistent Storage**: The website uses the browser's local storage to save tasks and projects. This means that all tasks and projects are stored even when the user leaves the website.
- **Today and This Week Views**: Users can view tasks that are due today or within the week.

## Usage

To use the website, simply add a task or a project using the provided buttons. For each task, you can set the title, description, due date, and priority level. You can also mark a task as done or not done.

Projects can be created with a custom name. Once a project is created, you can add tasks to it.

All tasks and projects are automatically saved in the browser's local storage, so you won't lose your data even if you close the website.
